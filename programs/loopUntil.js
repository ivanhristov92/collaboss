 Solve the following tasks using the main programming language, paradigm, and packages of your job position's specialization.
 Make sure to follow any programming principles you know, bust most importantly Test-Driven Development.
 We expect you to write code that is maintainable and that requires it to be fully testable.
 Make sure you solve for as many edge cases as you can think of!
 When you're done, create a private BitBucket repository for each task (or GitHub as long as it's private), upload your work, give permissions to admin@collaboss.com, and add the link below each task, so that we would be able to find and score your work.

/*
 Write a program that asks the user the maximum digit to loop until and return an
 array with the series of digits from 1 to the entered digit, but instead of numbers
 divisible by 3, use string ‘fizz’, by 5, use ‘buzz’, and by both, use ‘fizzbuzz’.
 For example, if we enter 15, we should get an array of 1, 2, ‘fizz’, 4, ‘buzz’, ‘fizz’, 7, 8, ‘fizz’, ‘buzz’, 11, ‘fizz’, 13, 14, ‘fizzbuzz’.
