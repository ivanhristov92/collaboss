/*
 Solve the following tasks using the main programming language, paradigm, and packages of your job position's specialization.
 Make sure to follow any programming principles you know, bust most importantly Test-Driven Development.
 We expect you to write code that is maintainable and that requires it to be fully testable.
 Make sure you solve for as many edge cases as you can think of!
 When you're done, create a private BitBucket repository for each task (or GitHub as long as it's private), upload your work, give permissions to admin@collaboss.com, and add the link below each task, so that we would be able to find and score your work.

/*
 Write a program that asks the user for a number and outputs an array of its prime factors.
 For example, if we pass 1, we should get an empty array.
 If we pass 2, we should get an array with only one element, which is 2 because two can be decomposed into 2 * 1.
 If we pass 4, we should get back an array of 2 and 2.
 If we pass 6, we should get an array of 2 and 3, but if we pass 100, then the program should return an array of 2, 2, 5, and 5.
