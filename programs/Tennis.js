 Solve the following tasks using the main programming language, paradigm, and packages of your job position's specialization.
 Make sure to follow any programming principles you know, bust most importantly Test-Driven Development.
 We expect you to write code that is maintainable and that requires it to be fully testable.
 Make sure you solve for as many edge cases as you can think of!
 When you're done, create a private BitBucket repository for each task (or GitHub as long as it's private), upload your work, give permissions to admin@collaboss.com, and add the link below each task, so that we would be able to find and score your work.

 Write a program that simulates a Tennis game. Given 2 players, randomly assign points to one of the players,
 then call the score (Thirty-Love, Deuce, Advantage Player 1, etc.) each time. For example, when the game starts,
 the score is Love-All. If Player 1 scores after the first round, the second score shown is Fifteen-Love.
 If Player 2 scores after the second round, the third score shown is Fifteen-All. If the game continues this way and
 both players get 4 points apiece, the score is Deuce. In other words, a random game’s output could be an array of
 Love-All, Fifteen-Love, Thirty-Love, Thirty-Fifteen, Thirty-All, Advantage Player 1, Deuce, Advantage Player 2, Win for
 Player 2. Obviously, there are a lot of other options for the game to unfold. If you’re not familiar with the scoring
 method for Tennis, simply google it and you will find what you need.
