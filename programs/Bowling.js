/*
 Solve the following tasks using the main programming language, paradigm, and packages of your job position's specialization.
 Make sure to follow any programming principles you know, bust most importantly Test-Driven Development.
 We expect you to write code that is maintainable and that requires it to be fully testable.
 Make sure you solve for as many edge cases as you can think of!
 When you're done, create a private BitBucket repository for each task (or GitHub as long as it's private), upload your work, give permissions to admin@collaboss.com, and add the link below each task, so that we would be able to find and score your work.

/*
 Write a program that simulates a Bowling game. Given 2 players, randomly assign roll attempts,
 then call the score for each round together with the total score. Each roll can knock 0-10 pins, so
 make sure spares and strikes are calculated properly. If youâ€™re not familiar with the rules of the game,
 simply google it and you will find what you need.
